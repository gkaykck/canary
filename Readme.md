# Kanarya

Kanarya is a very simple php script that can act as a music streaming server. There is a very simple frontend which let's you play, upload tracks, edit metadata, create a recursive list structure.

# How to use?

Just clone this repository and put upload all files to your hosting domain. You can use different frontends by changing index.html content.

# Why?

Usually when I personally buy a hosting plan, it's only used rarely for hosting some peoples blogs and some experiments. But usually my hosting provider
provides me with too much storage and bandwidth. So creating a project like this would let me use that wasted bandwidth/storage that I've actualy bought.

## Name

Kanarya is simply canary in Turkish. The bird is selected because one of my main goal is keeping this library as small and lean as possible.

# Contribution

Contributions are welcome. I am trying to keep everything in canary.php file at the moment. Just put up a pr request.
